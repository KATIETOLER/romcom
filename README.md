# RomCom
##Romance Book Cover Generator! 

*-Contributors: Katie Toler, Evan Wheeler
*-Technologies used: JS, CSS, HTML


  This project shows a randomly generated image of a romance novel. Each time the page is refreshed, a random title, cover image, and two descriptors are shown to the user. There are three pages to interact with: the home view, saved covers view, and the make your own cover form view. The user can click the 'Show New Random Cover' to generate a new cover. The user can also click the 'Make Your Own Cover' to make their own book cover, complete with adding their own image source, title, and descriptors. Finally, the project allows the user to save their own cover as well as to delete this cover by double-clicking the image.
